# Qubit
Qubit is a powerful and customizable Discord bot designed to simplify the lives of server administrators and staff.

Long ago were the days of copying and pasting answers to frequently asked questions. 
With Qubit, you can easily create 'Help Entries' using slash commands, making it a breeze for server administrators and staff to answer questions.

Qubit is also equipped with the ability to create tickets with the click of a button, simplifying the process for users to submit and resolve issues.
